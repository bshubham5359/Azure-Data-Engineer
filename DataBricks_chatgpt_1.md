### **Databricks-Specific Questions**

1. **What is Databricks, and how does it fit into the modern data ecosystem?**
   - **Answer:** Databricks is a unified data analytics platform that combines data engineering, machine learning, and data science. It leverages Apache Spark for big data processing and supports various file formats for structured and unstructured data.

2. **Can you explain the purpose of Databricks clusters?**
   - **Answer:** Databricks clusters are groups of computational resources that Databricks uses to run jobs or interactive queries. They enable distributed processing, scalability, and performance optimization.

3. **How do you optimize Databricks code for performance and scalability?**
   - **Answer:** Optimization involves using efficient Spark transformations (e.g., `map`, `reduceByKey` instead of `groupByKey`), caching data intelligently, using partitioning and bucketing strategies, and leveraging DataFrame API over RDDs for better performance.

4. **What is Delta Lake in Databricks, and why is it important?**
   - **Answer:** Delta Lake is a storage layer on top of data lakes that enables ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and data versioning, allowing for consistent reads and writes and ensuring data reliability.

5. **Can you walk me through the process of creating and configuring a cluster in Databricks?**
   - **Answer:** Cluster creation involves selecting a runtime version (e.g., Databricks Runtime), defining the worker and driver types, setting the number of workers, configuring autoscaling, and adding any necessary libraries.

6. **Explain the difference between Standard and High Concurrency clusters in Databricks.**
   - **Answer:** A Standard cluster is suitable for most development and production jobs, while High Concurrency clusters are optimized for concurrent queries, primarily for interactive workloads with multiple users.

7. **What strategies do you use for managing Databricks clusters to minimize costs?**
   - **Answer:** Use autoscaling, terminate idle clusters, schedule jobs to run in off-peak hours, and use spot instances where possible.

8. **Describe how Databricks handles data security and governance with Unity Catalog.**
   - **Answer:** Unity Catalog provides fine-grained governance by centralizing access controls across different data sources. It helps enforce permissions and enables sharing data securely across the platform.

9. **What are the different storage layers in Databricks?**
   - **Answer:** Databricks supports Bronze (raw data), Silver (cleaned and structured data), and Gold (aggregated business data) layers, allowing structured data pipelines.

10. **What is the role of Databricks Jobs, and how would you schedule them efficiently?**
    - **Answer:** Databricks Jobs allow scheduling of workflows, notebooks, or tasks. Jobs can be scheduled using the Databricks UI, API, or through automation frameworks like Apache Airflow.

### **PySpark & Apache Spark Questions**

11. **What are the key differences between RDD, DataFrame, and Dataset in PySpark?**
    - **Answer:** RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) is the low-level API that offers more control but is less optimized. DataFrames are optimized, schema-aware APIs, while Datasets provide the type-safety of RDDs with the optimization of DataFrames.

12. **Explain lazy evaluation in PySpark.**
    - **Answer:** Lazy evaluation means transformations are not executed immediately. PySpark builds an execution plan (DAG), and actions trigger the execution of the transformations.

13. **How do you handle skewed data in a Spark job?**
    - **Answer:** Handling skewed data involves techniques such as salting keys, increasing shuffle partitions, or using `broadcast joins` to optimize joins.

14. **What are Spark partitions, and how do they affect performance?**
    - **Answer:** Partitions are chunks of data distributed across the cluster. Optimizing partition size and number is key to balancing load across workers and improving performance.

15. **How would you implement windowing functions in PySpark?**
    - **Answer:** PySpark provides `Window` functions like `row_number()`, `rank()`, and `dense_rank()` for tasks that require comparisons between rows within the same partition.

### **Python & Coding Questions**

16. **How do you handle errors in your Python ETL code?**
    - **Answer:** Use `try-except` blocks to handle exceptions gracefully. Logging frameworks can also be used to log errors for debugging.

17. **What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy in Python?**
    - **Answer:** A shallow copy copies the reference pointers to objects, whereas a deep copy copies the objects themselves, leading to independent copies of nested objects.

18. **How would you optimize a Python ETL script to run faster?**
    - **Answer:** Optimization techniques include using efficient data structures, parallel processing (with libraries like `multiprocessing`), and avoiding unnecessary computations.

19. **What are Python decorators, and how would you use them in an ETL pipeline?**
    - **Answer:** Decorators are functions that modify the behavior of another function. They can be used to log execution time, handle retries, or add authentication in an ETL process.

20. **Explain the difference between `map()` and `filter()` in Python.**
    - **Answer:** `map()` applies a function to all items in an iterable, while `filter()` returns items of an iterable that satisfy a condition.

### **SQL & MySQL Questions**

21. **What is the difference between OLTP and OLAP systems?**
    - **Answer:** OLTP systems are designed for transaction processing and involve frequent inserts/updates (e.g., MySQL), while OLAP systems are used for data analysis and querying large datasets (e.g., Databricks, Snowflake).

22. **How do you optimize complex SQL queries for performance?**
    - **Answer:** Techniques include indexing key columns, avoiding SELECT *, using proper joins (INNER over OUTER when possible), partitioning large tables, and using EXPLAIN to analyze query plans.

23. **What is the difference between a primary key and a unique key in MySQL?**
    - **Answer:** A primary key uniquely identifies a row in a table and cannot be NULL, while a unique key also ensures uniqueness but can contain NULL values.

24. **How would you optimize an ETL pipeline that writes data into MySQL?**
    - **Answer:** Use bulk inserts instead of individual inserts, partition data for parallel writes, and optimize indexing and schema to ensure fast write operations.

25. **What are SQL window functions, and when would you use them?**
    - **Answer:** SQL window functions like `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, and `LEAD()` operate over a window of rows, often used for analytical queries where you need to perform calculations across a set of rows.

### **ETL and Data Engineering Questions**

26. **What is ETL, and why is it important for data pipelines?**
    - **Answer:** ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is the process of extracting data from sources, transforming it for analysis, and loading it into a target database. It ensures data consistency, quality, and integration.

27. **Can you describe a recent ETL pipeline you've implemented? What challenges did you face?**
    - **Answer:** [Candidateâ€™s experience-based answer.]

28. **How do you handle schema changes in ETL pipelines?**
    - **Answer:** Implement schema versioning, use schema evolution features in tools like Delta Lake, and build validation checks to handle evolving data structures.

29. **How would you implement incremental data loading in an ETL process?**
    - **Answer:** Implement strategies like CDC (Change Data Capture), using timestamps or version numbers to detect changes in source data and only load modified records.

30. **What is the importance of data partitioning in ETL processes?**
    - **Answer:** Partitioning helps distribute data processing, speeding up queries, reducing I/O costs, and making ETL jobs more scalable.
