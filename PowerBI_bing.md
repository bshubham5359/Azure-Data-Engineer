## Technical Skills

### Power BI Concepts:

Question: Can you explain the key components of Power BI and how you've used them in previous projects?

Answer: Power BI consists of Power BI Desktop, Power BI Service, and Power BI Mobile. I've used Power BI Desktop for data preparation and report creation, and Power BI Service to share reports and dashboards with stakeholders. In my last role, I integrated these tools to automate reporting and improve accessibility.

### Data Transformation:

Question: How do you use Power Query for data transformation in Power BI?

Answer: Power Query is my go-to for data transformation. It allows me to clean, combine, and shape data from multiple sources. For instance, I once used Power Query to merge sales data from different regions, apply necessary transformations, and ensure the data was ready for analysis in Power BI.

### DAX:

Question: Give an example of an optimized DAX script you wrote and the impact it had on your project.

Answer: I optimized a DAX script for a complex sales report, which involved calculating year-over-year growth while considering dynamic filters. This optimization reduced the query time significantly, enhancing the report's performance and user experience.

### Tabular Model Architecture:

Question: What is the VertiPaq engine, and how does it work in Power BI?

Answer: VertiPaq is an in-memory columnar storage engine that compresses data and improves query performance in Power BI. It stores data in a highly compressed format, enabling faster data retrieval and efficient memory usage. Understanding VertiPaq has helped me design more efficient data models.

## Practical Experience

### Report Lifecycle Management:

Question: Can you describe your experience with managing the report lifecycle, from development to deployment?

Answer: I've managed the entire report lifecycle, including development, testing, and deployment. I use deployment pipelines for version control, ensuring seamless transitions from development to production. This practice has streamlined report updates and minimized downtime.

### Access Management:

Question: How do you implement Row-Level Security (RLS) and Object-Level Security (OLS) in Power BI

Answer: I implement RLS by creating security roles and defining DAX filters to restrict data access based on user roles. For OLS, I use permissions to control access to specific tables or columns. These measures have ensured data security and compliance in my projects.

### Third-Party Tools:

Question: Which third-party tools have you integrated with Power BI, and for what purpose?

Answer: I've integrated tools like DAX Studio for performance tuning, and SQL Server for data extraction and transformation. These integrations have enhanced my ability to handle complex data scenarios and deliver high-performance reports.

## General and Behavioral

### SQL and Database Concepts:

Question: Explain a complex SQL query you wrote and the problem it solved.

Answer: I wrote a complex SQL query to aggregate sales data across multiple dimensions, including time, region, and product. This query provided key insights into sales trends and helped the marketing team target their campaigns more effectively.

### Data Modeling and Optimization:

Question: How do you ensure your data models are optimized for performance?

Answer: I follow best practices like reducing cardinality, using appropriate data types, and optimizing DAX calculations. Additionally, I regularly review and refactor my models to ensure they meet performance standards.

### Cultural Fit:

Question: Describe a time when you had to collaborate with a team to achieve a common goal. How did you handle it?

Answer: In my previous role, I collaborated with the marketing and IT teams to develop a comprehensive sales dashboard. We held regular meetings to align our objectives and share progress. My ability to communicate technical concepts clearly ensured we stayed on track and met our goals.
