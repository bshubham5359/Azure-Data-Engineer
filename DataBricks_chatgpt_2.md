### **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Questions (Continued)**

86. **Can you explain the difference between batch processing and stream processing in ETL?**  
    - **Batch processing** handles large volumes of data in scheduled intervals, while **stream processing** handles data in real-time, processing it as it arrives. Batch processing is suitable for periodic updates, while stream processing is used for continuous real-time analytics.

87. **What is incremental data loading, and how do you implement it in an ETL pipeline?**  
    - Incremental loading updates only the new or changed data since the last load. You can implement it by tracking changes using timestamps, versioning, or change data capture (CDC) methods, reducing the need to reprocess all data.

88. **How do you manage large-scale data transformations in ETL processes?**  
    - Use distributed processing frameworks (e.g., Apache Spark, Hadoop), optimize transformations (e.g., vectorized operations in Pandas or Spark DataFrames), and ensure efficient memory usage by chunking data or using parallel processing.

89. **What are some common challenges you’ve faced in ETL pipelines, and how did you address them?**  
    - **Common challenges** include handling schema changes, data quality issues, and performance bottlenecks. Solutions include schema versioning, data validation checks, incremental loads, and using partitioning or indexing to improve performance.

90. **How do you optimize the performance of ETL pipelines?**  
    - Optimize by using parallelism, partitioning data, tuning resource allocation (CPU, memory), minimizing shuffling in distributed systems, and processing only changed data (incremental loading).

91. **What is data partitioning in ETL, and why is it important?**  
    - Data partitioning involves splitting large datasets into smaller, more manageable chunks, improving performance by allowing parallel processing and minimizing data scanned in each ETL run.

92. **How do you handle data validation in ETL processes?**  
    - Implement checks such as schema validation, data completeness, duplicate detection, and data type checks. Use validation frameworks, test suites, and monitoring tools to ensure data quality.

93. **What are some common ETL best practices you follow?**  
    - Use incremental loads where possible, automate error handling, log failures, ensure idempotency (re-runnable pipelines), monitor performance, and apply proper version control to transformation scripts.

94. **How do you monitor and schedule ETL workflows?**  
    - Use scheduling tools like Apache Airflow, Apache Oozie, or cloud-based orchestration services like AWS Step Functions or Azure Data Factory. Monitoring can be done through logging frameworks, metrics, and alerting systems to track job status and performance.

95. **What is the role of metadata in ETL pipelines?**  
    - Metadata provides information about the structure, source, and lineage of data, enabling better management, governance, and traceability within ETL pipelines. It helps in automating transformations, ensuring consistency, and facilitating auditing.

96. **How do you manage error handling and logging in ETL processes?**  
    - Implement try-catch mechanisms in ETL scripts to capture errors, log them using logging frameworks, and ensure proper retries for transient issues. Use centralized logging services (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk) for better visibility.

97. **Can you explain how ETL pipelines are implemented in Databricks?**

Delta Lake enables ACID-compliant ETL processes with support for time travel and schema evolution. Workflows are orchestrated using Databricks Jobs or external tools like Airflow.

98. **How do you handle data encryption and security in ETL processes?**  
    - Use encryption for data at rest and in transit (e.g., SSL, TLS). Ensure access control through authentication and role-based access (RBAC). Sensitive data can be masked or tokenized, and data in pipelines should comply with security and privacy regulations.

99. **How do you handle the transformation of semi-structured or unstructured data in ETL?**  
    - Use tools and libraries that parse semi-structured data formats (e.g., JSON, XML) and transform them into structured formats. For unstructured data (e.g., text, images), leverage NLP, OCR, or custom parsing techniques to extract useful features before transformation.

100. **What is ELT, and how does it differ from ETL?**  
     - In **ELT** (Extract, Load, Transform), data is first loaded into the destination (e.g., data warehouse) and then transformed. This contrasts with **ETL**, where transformation occurs before loading. ELT is commonly used in cloud-based data architectures, where transformations can be offloaded to the data warehouse for scalability.
