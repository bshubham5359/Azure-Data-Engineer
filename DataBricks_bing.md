## Technical Skills

### Databricks Expertise:

Question: Describe your experience working with Databricks clusters and how you've managed them.

Answer: I have extensive experience with Databricks clusters, including setting up, configuring, and optimizing them. For instance, I managed a cluster that processed real-time data streams, ensuring it scaled efficiently to handle peak loads.

### File Formats:

Question: What file formats have you worked with in Databricks, and how do you choose the best format for a specific use case?

Answer: I've worked with various file formats like Parquet, ORC, Avro, and Delta. I choose the format based on factors such as query performance, storage efficiency, and the specific requirements of the data processing task. For example, I use Parquet for its efficiency in read-heavy workloads.

### Performance Optimization:

Question: How do you optimize Databricks code to ensure high performance and scalability?

Answer: I focus on optimizing Spark jobs by minimizing shuffles, using efficient data formats, and implementing proper caching. I also conduct regular code reviews and performance tuning sessions. For a recent project, these practices reduced job execution time by 40%.

Unity Catalog:

Question: Explain your understanding of Unity Catalog and how it enables data sharing across the platform.

Answer: Unity Catalog centralizes governance for data and AI assets, allowing secure data sharing across the Databricks ecosystem. It ensures data consistency and security by managing access controls and auditing data usage. I've used Unity Catalog to streamline data access for cross-functional teams.

## Practical Experience

### ETL Processes:

Question: Can you describe a complex ETL process you've implemented using Databricks and the challenges you faced?

Answer: I designed an ETL pipeline that ingested data from multiple sources, applied transformations using PySpark, and stored the results in a data warehouse. One challenge was handling schema evolution, which I addressed by implementing schema drift handling techniques.

### Python and PySpark:

Question: How do you use Python and PySpark in your data processing workflows?

Answer: I leverage Python for scripting and orchestration tasks, while PySpark is used for distributed data processing. For example, I wrote PySpark jobs to clean and aggregate large datasets, which improved data quality and preparation for analysis.

### SQL Skills:

Question: Share an example of a complex SQL query you wrote and its impact on a project.

Answer: I wrote a SQL query to join multiple large tables and perform aggregations for a business intelligence report. The query optimized report generation and provided key insights to stakeholders, ultimately supporting better decision-making.

## Cultural Fit

### Continuous Improvement:

Question: How do you identify and implement continuous improvement areas in your data processes?

Answer: I regularly review data pipelines for inefficiencies and conduct post-mortems after major projects to identify improvement areas. I also stay updated with the latest Databricks features and best practices to ensure our processes are up-to-date and efficient.

### Collaboration:

Question: Describe a time when you worked with a team to solve a challenging problem. How did you handle it?

Answer: In a previous project, our team faced a challenge with data latency. We collaborated by holding brainstorming sessions, dividing tasks based on expertise, and constantly communicating progress. My ability to mediate and align team efforts resulted in a successful resolution.
