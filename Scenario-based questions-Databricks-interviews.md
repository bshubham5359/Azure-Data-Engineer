## **Scenario-based questions** that are typically asked in **Databricks interviews**


1. **Scenario**: You have a large dataset with skewed data. How would you optimize a join operation?
   
    **Answer**:
    - Utilize Adaptive Query Execution (AQE) for dynamic optimization
    - Consider broadcast joins for smaller tables
    - Use salting techniques to distribute skewed keys
    - Implement bucketing on join columns


1. **Scenario**: You need to process a stream of data in near real-time. How would you approach this using Databricks?
 
    **Answer**:
    - Use Structured Streaming in Databricks
    - Set up a streaming source (e.g., Kafka, Event Hubs)
    - Define the streaming query and output sink
    - Implement watermarking and windowing for late data handling


2. **Scenario**: You're dealing with sensitive data. How would you ensure data security in Databricks?
   
    **Answer**:
    - Implement table access control (ACLs)
    - Use Databricks secrets for managing credentials
    - Enable encryption at rest and in transit
    - Implement column-level encryption for highly sensitive data
    - Use Databricks' integration with Azure AD or AWS IAM for authentication
  
3. **Scenario**: Your Spark job is running slowly. How would you diagnose and optimize it?
   
    **Answer**:
    - Check the Spark Ul for stage details and bottlenecks
    - Look for data skew, shuffle operations, or spilling to disk
    - Optimize join operations (broadcast vs. shuffle hash join)
    - Adjust partitioning and caching strategies
    - Use Databricks' Query Optimization Advisor
  
4. **Scenario**: You need to implement a machine learning pipeline in Databricks. How would you approach this?
   
    **Answer**:
    - Use MLflow for experiment tracking and model management
    - Leverage Spark MLlib for distributed ML algorithms
    - Implement feature engineering using Spark SQL and DataFrame operations
    - Use Databricks AutoML for quick prototyping
    - Set up model serving using MLflow and Databricks Model Serving
  
5. **Scenario**: You're migrating an on-premises data warehouse to Databricks. What steps would you take?


    **Answer**:
    - Assess current data and workloads
    - Design a new data architecture using Delta Lake
    - Use Databricks' ETL tools for data migration
    - Implement slowly changing dimensions using Delta Lake merge operations
    - Set up proper access controls and governance
    - Optimize query performance using Databricks SQL warehouses
